**This is a plan for the project** 
The idea is to create a web based chess that allows users to play against different AI models. These are regular models and advanced AI models.

Core features of the project:
1. User can play against a regular AI model
2. User can see the logs of the game
3. User can download the logs of the game
4. User can play agains other users
   4.a User can send a link to invite the user to play.
   
5. Leaderboard
   5.1 Leaderboard is activated when the user plays against AI models.
   5.2 Score is based on the number of moves and the time taken to finish the game.

6. A system to score users based on their performance.
   6.1 Score is based on the number of games won and the time taken to finish the game.

7. Badges - 
   7.1 Badges are awarded to users for completing certain tasks.
       7.1.1. Badge for winning a game against a regular AI model.
       7.1.2. Badge for winning a game against an advanced AI model.
       7.1.3. Badge for winning a game against a user.
       7.1.4. Badge for winning a game against a user in a short time.
       7.1.5. Badge for winning a game against a user in a long time.
       7.1.6. Badge for winning a game under 'x' moves
       7.1.7. Badge for *different* moves
8. Monetization - 
   8.1. Users can purchase a subscription to access advanced AI models.
   8.2. Users can purchase a subscription to view analytics(most used keys and tactics. Most played regiom etc)  of their games.
   8.3. Users need to purchase to create an account and enter leaderboard.
   8.4. No ads/popups/etc.
   8.5. Users can save game and see others games (if saved by other users)

9. User Authentication & Profiles
   9.1. User registration and login system
   9.2. Profile customization (avatar, bio, preferred time controls)
   9.3. Game history and statistics
   9.4. Rating system (ELO/Glicko)

10. Game Features
    10.1. Different time controls (Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, Classical)
    10.2. Game modes (Standard, Fischer Random/Chess960)
    10.3. Draw offers and resignation options
    10.4. Move validation and legal move highlighting
    10.5. Game analysis tools
    10.6. Position setup/board editor

11. Social Features
    11.1. Friends list
    11.2. Chat system (in-game and lobby)
    11.3. Clubs/teams
    11.4. Tournaments
    11.5. Spectator mode for ongoing games

12. Technical Considerations
    12.1. Anti-cheating measures
    12.2. Server-side move validation
    12.3. Handling disconnections/reconnections
    12.4. Game state persistence
    12.5. API rate limiting
    12.6. Mobile responsiveness

13. Educational Features
    13.1. Interactive tutorials
    13.2. Puzzle system
    13.3. Opening explorer
    13.4. Post-game analysis with AI suggestions
    13.5. Common pattern recognition training

14. Accessibility
    14.1. Screen reader support
    14.2. Keyboard navigation
    14.3. Color blind modes
    14.4. Multiple language support


    Erorrs fixed -
    1. Attempting to make a move and returning to the original position is throwing "invaid move error" when its not.

Fixed Bugs Log:
1. Captured pieces by white player were not being displayed correctly
   - Fixed by updating the capture handling logic in handleAIMove and handleDrop
   - Date fixed: [Current Date]

2. Board orientation was resetting to default on page refresh
   - Fixed by properly persisting and loading orientation from localStorage
   - Date fixed: [Current Date]

3. Attempting to make a move and returning to the original position was throwing "invalid move error"
   - Fixed by adding proper handling for same-square drops in handleDrop function
   - Date fixed: [Current Date]

4. AI move errors were being displayed even when moves were valid
   - Fixed by improving error handling and removing unnecessary error toasts
   - Date fixed: [Current Date]

5. Player name display inconsistency between local and production environments
   - Fixed by implementing proper state management and localStorage sync
   - Added mobile-responsive display above chessboard
   - Date fixed: [Current Date]

Known Issues to Fix:
1. Hydration issues possible with current localStorage implementation
2. Missing error handling for localStorage operations
3. Console logs present in production code
4. Potential performance issues with unnecessary re-renders

Technical Debt Log:
1. State Management
   - Direct localStorage access during state initialization
   - No centralized state management solution
   - Missing proper state synchronization

2. Type Safety
   - Missing TypeScript implementation
   - No PropTypes definitions
   - Lack of proper interface definitions

3. Error Handling
   - Missing error boundaries
   - Incomplete error handling for async operations
   - No fallback UI for error states

4. Testing
   - Missing unit tests for components
   - No integration tests
   - No end-to-end testing setup

5. Accessibility
   - Missing ARIA labels
   - No keyboard navigation support
   - Missing screen reader considerations
   - No color contrast compliance checking

6. Performance
   - Unoptimized re-renders
   - No code splitting
   - Missing performance monitoring
   - No lazy loading implementation

7. Code Quality
   - Heavy reliance on Tailwind utility classes
   - Missing documentation for complex logic
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Console logs in production code

8. Build & Deploy
   - No proper build optimization
   - Missing source maps configuration
   - No proper environment variable handling

Priority Fixes Needed:
1. Implement proper state management solution (Redux/Context)
2. Add TypeScript support
3. Implement error boundaries
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Add basic accessibility features

Development Standards To Implement:
1. Code Review Checklist
2. Testing Requirements
3. Documentation Standards
4. Performance Benchmarks
5. Accessibility Requirements
